# Capulus

Unified cafe app

## Get Started

**For development**, run this command in terminal

```
php run
```

Then the website is ready to serve at https://localhost:8000  
You can change the address by setting `base_url` in `config.php`

---

**For production**, just configure your favorite web server and point it to `/public/index.php`  
Don't forget to change `base_url` to your domain name or address.
